# angle-datatable-bubble
Sample file for showing problem with bubble edit.

Hello,

This is a sample file for displaying a problem with bubble edit on the Angle layout.

It's for the rails version

When starting it with rails (rails s -p 3000) 

The first table contains a json include and bubble edit.

http://localhost:3000/tables/datatable

When pressing a field, "bubble edit" is started, but not vissible.

I need some help to get this working on this specific layout.

A screenshot shows that bubble edit is creating his thing on the right place and I assume it will be a stylesheet issue.

Regards,

Sander
